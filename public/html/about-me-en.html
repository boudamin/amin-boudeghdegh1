  <section class="about">
    <p><strong>Hello!</strong> I'm Amin Boudeghdegh, born on February 2, 1990. I am a passionate and versatile
      professional with a strong background in electrical engineering and software development. Currently based in
      Gatineau, QC, I am fluent in Arabic, French, English, and Spanish, with basic knowledge of Portuguese, Italian,
      German, and Russian.</p>

    <p>My journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, followed by a Master's degree in the same
      field, specializing in Electronics and Communication Systems from the University of Mohamed Seddik Benyahia in
      Algeria. Over the years, I have gained extensive experience working in various roles, from an Electrical Engineer
      to an Independent Android Developer.</p>

    <p>In my career, I have worked with renowned companies such as Algerian Qatari Steel and Hyundai Engineering, where
      I honed my skills in electrical maintenance, instrumentation, and project supervision. My role as an Independent
      Android Developer has allowed me to explore my creativity and technical expertise, leading to the successful
      development and sale of several Android applications, including the sophisticated Beauty Calculator app.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am furthering my education in computer programming at Collège LaCité, continuously expanding my
      knowledge and staying updated with the latest technological advancements. My technical skills span across various
      programming languages and software, including Java, Kotlin, C#, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, and more.</p>
